# RCJoystick
An Arduino Pro Micro connects to a 6 Channel RC Receiver to emulate a joystick. 

Use this project and its PCB to practice on a Flight Simulator. The Arduino Pro Micro can read the values of each of the channels and can be interfaced to other projects as well. 

Not all RC recievers support SBUS/PPM outputs, and most of the time, the signals are available on individual channels. (CH1-CH6). 

The need to design the board was to run a class on Aeromodelling. 

The setup was as such where I can demonstrate on a projector how to fly an airplane, then the Transmitter can travel through the class as each student pilots the craft, while others watch.
