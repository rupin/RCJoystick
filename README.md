# RCJoystick
An Arduino Pro Micro connects to a 6 Channel RC Receiver to emulate a joystick. 

Use this project and its PCB to practice on a Flight Simulator. The Arduino Pro Micro can read the values of each of the channels and can be interfaced to other projects as well. 

Not all RC recievers support SBUS/PPM outputs, and most of the time, the signals are available on individual channels. (CH1-CH6).
